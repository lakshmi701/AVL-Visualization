# AVL Tree Visualization
An interactive visualization of an **AVL Tree (Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree)** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how AVL trees maintain balance through rotations during insert and delete operations.

## Features
- Insert nodes dynamically
- Delete nodes with automatic rebalancing
- Visual representation of AVL rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
- Balance factor displayed for each node
- Inorder traversal visualization
- Tree height and total node count
- Random node insertion
- Operation history tracking
- Interactive and responsive SVG-based UI

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- SVG for tree rendering
